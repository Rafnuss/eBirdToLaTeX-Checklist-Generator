# eBirdToLaTex Checklist Generator #
eBirdToLaTex Checklist Generator is a Python module which generates a customisable bird checklist based on a specific dataset downloaded from [eBird](http://ebird.org/). The web version of the generator is not available anymore as eBird is requiring to login to get barchart data.

## Where to start?
Have a look at [`script_e2L.ipynb`](https://github.com/Zoziologie/ebird2latex/blob/master/script_e2L.ipynb) which gives an example on how to use the `e2L` python module.

## Requirement
 - python (only python3 has been tested) with a a couple of standard libraries: `requests`,`re`,`lxml`
 - latex (`pdflatex`)
 - eBird login to download barchart data and your target
